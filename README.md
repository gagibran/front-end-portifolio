# Friday Night Softwares
## Welcome to the website for my soon-to-be gaming studio! 
<p>Link: http://fridaynightsoftwares.epizy.com</p>
<p>I am currently using it as a portfolio. So the website is just an infopage on Bloodborne. I created it to apply what I learned from my full-stack studies. The web host used is free and provided by <a href="https://infinityfree.net/">InfinityFree</a>. On the <a href="http://fridaynightsoftwares.epizy.com/?i=1">front page</a> there is also a link to a <a href="http://fridaynightsoftwares.epizy.com/form.html">form</a> that I created using pure CSS, HTML and JavaScript. No frameworks.</p>

<p>Feedbacks are much appreciated! Thanks for reading!</p>
