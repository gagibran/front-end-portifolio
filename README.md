# Front-end Portifolio

## A portifolio for a static website and a form, made with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I am currently using it as a portfolio. So the website is just an infopage on Bloodborne. I created it to apply what I learned from my full-stack studies. The hosting is provided by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). [Here](https://gagibran.github.io/front-end-portifolio/) is the link to the website and [here](https://gagibran.github.io/front-end-portifolio/form.html) is the link to the from.

All images have been credited to their respective authors on the <a href="http://fridaynightsoftwares.epizy.com/?i=1">front page</a>'s disclaimer section.

Feedbacks are much appreciated! Thanks for reading!
